1. Using cuda() to move data to GPU.
Original sample runs on CPU!
GPU is far slower (double the time) than CPU
2. RNN from scratch
New to pyTorch, as usual, wanted to learn by doing things from scratch. Below are a few blogs that got me going.

Number 1, really from scratch

ImageRNN but it is using nn.RNN, I wanted even lower.. ðŸ™‚

PyTorch â€“ Tutorial that set me thinking..but this is text classification not using Dataloader and batch processing, as I consider batching is tricky one to get going, so, I wanted to indulge on it ðŸ˜‰
